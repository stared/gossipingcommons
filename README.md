# Gossiping Commons

*Ever wondered if you can share a gossip? Now there is a license framework for that!*

"WORK" IN PROGRESS (feel invited to join, contribute, or distract me (the last one is significantly easier))

It was intended to be for the April Fools' Day (2019), but I didn't take this deadline too seriously.
Plus, you know, it is hard to compete with all these corporate adverts.


## Example licenses

### No author please, and don't tell anyone

It if is a secret, it is a secret! So, don't tell anyone anything. Especially that you know that from me!

It is a strict restriction and I will honor that!
I mean, I know can share with Max, because I am are sure they won't share it with anyone!

### Don't tell all of that

The best way to protect privacy is to make sure all derivative work has changes, step by step, making it unrecognizable.

The power of gossips is the creative spirit of exaggerations, misheard words, wrongly attributed intentions, and stuff. It has created civilizations. Now, you can use it to your boring anecdotes as well!

E.g.:

> A friend of mine solicited her student to act in an adult movie with pterodactyls.

Well, if we trace the creative chain, the last version I know... well, I cannot tell previous versions.
But I guarantee it was enriched in a gradual way, but a lot of people.

### Don't be Judas, no exaggerations

Workplace "wisdom of crowds" has different rights. You really want to be free from slanders, and have your career intact. By a rat backstabbing you in an exchange for a company meeting in Bali.

So, how to handle goss-, I mean, Social Information™?

Writing of your (true!) stories you told them during integration parties, writing blog posts changing the protagonist name to their own, and monetizing on adverts would not be cool.

Also, selling your friend for ₿3.0 is not cool. And well, if you use this license, it is also illegal.

### Whatever, tell whomever you please!

Good press is good press. Bad press is good press. There is no such things a bad publicity. Have you ever hear about bad likes or reshares?

Stunt marketing owes a lot [this piece of ancient wisdom]((https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herostratus).

Psst -  we can be quiet about that.

### More logos!
